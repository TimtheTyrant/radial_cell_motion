Simulations of Radial Cell Motion
</h4>

<p>This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and data associated with "Cell dispersal by localized degradation of a chemoattractant" (Karmakar, Tyree, Gomer, Rappel, 2021).  Inward/Outward cell motion was simulated using local cell rules that suppose constant cell speed according to</p>

The default value is previously suggested, and for a 15Âµm long Dictyostelium discoideum cell with a 0.1nM cAMP drop accross its length, g_thresh = 0.1/15.<br>

<p>This repository contains the Cell() class, which represents cell motion predicted by the constant radial speed models. Cell() is a 1D cellular automaton for radial cell motion in the presence of a chemoattractant and a chemorepellent.</p>
	
<p>This repository also supports running batches of simulations in parallel and measuring/storing values of interest for each batch. </p>

<p>I feel the code in this repository is reasonably well-documented, however it is riddled with "#TODO: " comments describing simple and clear incremental improvements. Feel free to contribute!  Have a nice day!</p>
